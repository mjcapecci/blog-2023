Introducing Simply Pomodoro - the new iOS app that harnesses the power of the Pomodoro Technique to enhance your productivity, but with an added sprinkle of simplicity. Designed for the modern multitasker, Simply Pomodoro makes it easy to master the art of time management, by turning your busy schedule into manageable intervals of work and rest. With the added benefit of notifications to alert you when each round is completed, it takes the stress out of keeping track of time, allowing you to focus on the task at hand.

Simply Pomodoro stands out with its clear and user-friendly interface, making it a joy to use. It is not just a timer; itâ€™s a tool to help you perform your best. Following the classic Pomodoro Technique, each 25-minute work round is followed by a 5-minute break. After completing three work rounds, you are rewarded with a 20-minute break. This allows you to recharge, refocus, and, consequently, optimize your productivity. This well-balanced cycle ensures that you're not just working hard, but working smart, too.

It offers a reflection of your work habits and gives you insight into when you are most productive, so you can align your tasks accordingly.
