Launching Frontier Web Development was more than just an exercise in starting a businessâ€”it was an opportunity to be at the forefront of some awesome projects for a range of professionals within various industries. It was a chance to learn and grow as a developer, and to gain a deeper understanding of the business side of web development. It was also a chance to work alongside some great people and to build a network of contacts that I still maintain today.

From Shopify stores and applications to dynamic websites for dentists and other professionals, the major projects completed under Frontier Web Development allowed me to hone my skills with React, Node.js and TypeScript. Each project was an opportunity to refine my abilities, transforming every coding challenge into a stepping stone for future assignments. This immersive, practical experience led to a better grasp of these technologies, preparing me for more complex roles in my future career.

Ultimately, Frontier Web Development transitioned into a steady state of servicing a few remaining clients, and the initial phase of rapid growth and expansion has wound down. The insights gained and the experience accrued during this journey have been instrumental in shaping my professional outlook. It has been a vital chapter in my career, allowing me to evolve from being purely a developer to taking on more strategic, business-focused responsibilities. In the end, it was not only about the technical skills gained but also about beginning to gain an understanding of the bigger picture, and how to deliver value in our digital landscape.
