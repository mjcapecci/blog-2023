Launching Frontier Web Development was more than just an exercise in starting a businessâ€”it was an opportunity to be at the forefront of exciting projects and meet a range of professionals within the industry. This was not just about driving innovation but also about facilitating effective collaborations. Each project was a step towards understanding the broader scope of the digital world and the complex interplay between technology and human needs.

The management aspect of Frontier Web Development broadened my understanding of the business side of development and engineering. Unlike my current corporate role, this venture allowed me a direct line of communication with clients and a more in-depth understanding of the market's dynamics. It was less about rigidly adhering to pre-set objectives and more about adapting to client needs and market trends. This approach offered a unique blend of business strategy, client management, and problem-solving.

From Shopify stores and applications to dynamic websites for dentists and other professionals, the major projects completed under Frontier Web Development allowed me to hone my skills with React, Node.js and TypeScript. Each project was an opportunity to refine my abilities, transforming every coding challenge into a stepping stone for future assignments. This immersive, practical experience led to a better grasp of these technologies, preparing me for more complex roles in my future career.

Ultimately, Frontier Web Development transitioned into a steady state of servicing a few remaining clients, and the initial phase of rapid growth and expansion has wound down. The insights gained and the experience accrued during this journey have been instrumental in shaping my professional outlook. It has been a vital chapter in my career, allowing me to evolve from being purely a developer to taking on more strategic, business-focused roles. In the end, it's not only about the technical skills gained but also about understanding the bigger picture of the rapidly evolving digital landscape.
